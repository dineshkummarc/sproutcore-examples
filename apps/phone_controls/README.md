PhoneControls
=============

This Sproutcore example showcases Sproutcore user interface elements in
an application designed for browsing on an iPhone or other mobile device.

It is a descendant of test_controls, which is the same showcase made for
desktop browsers. test_controls, in turn, is based on Alex Iskander's
[test_controls app](http://create.tpsitulsa.com/sc/test_controls.html).
