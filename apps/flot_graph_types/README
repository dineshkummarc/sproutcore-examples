Project:   FlotGraphTypes
=============================================================================

This Sproutcore example takes the code of the Flot Javacript library's 
graph types example:

    http://people.iola.dk/olau/flot/examples/

DEPENDS ON:

    http://github.com/imxiaobo/iamxiaobo/tree/master/flot-integration

    I cloned the flot-integration code, which is a full Sproutcore project
    with Buildfile. I got the flot-integration demo working. Then I copied
    flot-integration/frameworks/flot into the same dir of my own project.
    
MY Buildfile entries:
         
    For flot:
 
        config :flot, :required => [:sproutcore]

    So sc-build will build tmp/build/sc/flot_graph_types/...
     
        config :flot_dual_axis, :url_prefix => "/sc/flot_graph_types/"
         
    To pull in flot:
                            
        config :flot_dual_axis, :required => [:sproutcore, 'flot']
                                      ~
