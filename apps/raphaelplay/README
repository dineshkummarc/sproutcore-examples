This Sproutcore example takes the code of the Raphael Javacript library's 
Australia example (http://raphaeljs.com/australia.html), and puts it in a 
Sproutcore View. 

Questions:

* Can the Raphael object be put in its own controller, or in the existing
  Australian states controller?
  
* Is updateLayer() the place for the Raphael setup? (couldn't get it to work
  by putting it in an init function).  Look at SCUI/Sai, which is a wrapper 
  that already exists for Raphael. Look at how renderi(), didAppendToDocument(), 
  and willDestroyLateri() are used.
  
* Evaluate the use of SC.runloop.begin() and .end(). Needed? When? Initially, 
  and perhaps permanently, these .begin() and .end() calls wrap the code within
  the callback from Raphael (onmouseover, onmouseout) events. On irc one day
  Alex Iskander answered a question about this:
    
    Under what circumstances would runloop.begin() and runloop.end() be used?
