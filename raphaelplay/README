Project:   RaphaelPlay
=============================================================================

This Sproutcore example takes the code of the Raphael Javacript library's 
Australia example (http://raphaeljs.com/australia.html), and puts it in a 
Sproutcore View. Two other views are defined, one at the top of the page is 
tied by contentBinding to the selected Australian state, and the other at the 
right is tied to the same controller and the selected state.

TODO:

Use of "selection" terminology needs to be changed to "current," for the
highlighted Australian state, because it is mouse rollover that fires, not a 
mouse click.

Can the Raphael object be put in its own controller, or in the existing
Australian states controller?

Is updateLayer() the place for the Raphael setup? (couldn't get it to work
by putting it in an init function). updateLayer() sounds like something that
would be repeatedly called, but the concept of init() vs. updateLayer() 
elude me now.

Move the detail view to the bottom, or make it fit in a display with the map
on the left. 

Split this example into two, one for the existing sort of rollover action, 
and another for typical mouse click seleciton. For the rollover example,
drop the list, which was put there for learning purposes. Keep the list in
the mouse click example, and perhaps put the map/detail display on the right, 
to place focus on selection first.
