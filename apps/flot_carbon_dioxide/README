Project:   FlotCarbonDioxide

This Sproutcore example uses the Flot javascript library:

    http://code.google.com/p/flot/

It shows data from:

    http://www.esrl.no@.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/

DEPENDS ON:

    http://github.com/imxiaobo/iamxiaobo/tree/master/flot-integration

    I cloned the flot-integration code, which is a full Sproutcore project
    with Buildfile. I got the flot-integration demo working. Then I copied
    flot-integration/frameworks/flot into the same dir of my own project.
    
MY Buildfile entries:
         
    For flot:
 
        config :flot, :required => [:sproutcore]

    So sc-build will build tmp/build/sc/flot_carbon_dioxide/...
     
        config :flot_dual_axis, :url_prefix => "/sc/flot_carbon_dioxide/"
         
    To pull in flot:
                            
        config :flot_dual_axis, :required => [:sproutcore, 'flot']
                                      ~
